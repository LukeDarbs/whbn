   	      <p>It’s ironic but design agencies often end up neglecting their own
   	        brand and online presence with client work taking precedent. It’s
   	        fair to say that when I started looking at the brand for my former
   	        employer, it was well due. We decided to tackle the website as part
   	        of a rebranding project which saw the agency adopt a series of simple
   	        illustrative ‘t’ icons that gave an idea of the breadth of the studio’s
   	        work. The concepts that I produced for the website were designed
   	        to be functional and neutral allowing the work examples displayed
   	        to take centre stage.</p>

        title="Marie Stopes International, Cries &amp; Whispers"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-msi-c&amp;w-thumb.jpg" alt="MSI Publication" /></a>
        <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/msi-c&amp;w/idic-msi-c&amp;w-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-msi01" title="Marie Stopes International, Cries &amp; Whispers"></a>
        <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/msi-c&amp;w/idic-msi-c&amp;w-03.jpg" rel="lightbox-msi01" title="Marie Stopes International, Cries &amp; Whispers"></a>
	      <p>I was delighted when selected by Marie Stopes International to design
	        their flagship publication, Cries &amp; Whispers, thanks to a history
	        of successful projects for the international healthcare organization.
	        A great amount of work had gone in to the compilation of content which
	        was primarily made up of statements from the World’s leading figures
	        regarding abortion and very personal testimonies of womens’ first hand
	        experiences.&nbsp; My concepts had to illustrate this particular plight
	        of women in the developing world without diluting the impact of their
	        statements and testimonies. The eventual design made use of carefully
	        selected and adjusted imagery and clear space to achieve the greatest
	        impact. </p>
	    
	    <h2>Association of Business Practitioners, Website</h2>

        title="Association of Business Practitioners, Website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abp.org.uk&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.abp.org.uk&lt;/a&gt;">
  <img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-abp-website-thumb.jpg" alt="ABP Website" /></a>
	      <p>The concept and design of ABP’s first website formed the final stage
	        of a branding project for the awarding body.&nbsp; The brief was to
	        keep the design fresh, simple, corporate and on-brand, concentrating
	        on clear navigation and ease of use.&nbsp; It was also crucial for the
	        website’s coding to be perfectly clean and clear to aid accessibility
	        and allow ABP’s own IT department to control updates to content. I used
	        a mixture of hand-coded XHTML, CSS and PHP to help streamline developments
      to the site and allow for dynamic navigation.</p>

          <h2>Noddy, Illustration</h2>
            <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/noddy/idic-noddy-scarf-face-kite.jpg" rel="lightbox-noddy" 
            title="Noddy Illustration"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-noddy-scarfface-thumb.jpg" alt="Noddy Illustration" /></a>

          <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/noddy/idic-noddy-sketch-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-noddy" title="Noddy Illustration"></a>
          <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/noddy/idic-noddy-scarf-face-beretta.jpg" rel="lightbox-noddy" title="Alternative version"></a>
          <p>Inspired by the iconic poster art for Scarface, I wanted to see if I could bring Pachino's 
          menace to an unexpected character. I remember watching Noddy as a child, long before I was old enough
          to watch Oliver Stone's 1983 classic and really enjoyed making him look threatening. </p>

          <h2>Oceanwave, A5 Flyer</h2>
            <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/oceanwave/idic-oceanwave-flyer-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-oceanwave" 
            title="Oceanwave, A5 Flyer"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-oceanwave-flyer-thumb.jpg" alt="Oceanwave Flyer" /></a>
          <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/oceanwave/idic-oceanwave-flyer-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-oceanwave" title="Oceanwave, A5 Flyer"></a>
          <p>Oceanwave are now one of the UK’s leading providers of Wireless internet
	        for Marinas. I had the pleasure of working with the company from the
	        start and the design of this eye-catching flyer was one of the first
	        projects we completed for them, raising awareness and generating interest
	        to help the start-up gain momentum. </p>

        <h2>Meteor Asset Management, Innovative Solutions Advert</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/meteor/idic-meteor-innovative-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-meteor"

        <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/meteor/idic-meteor-innovative-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-meteor" 
        title="Meteor Asset Management, Innovative Solutions Advert"></a>
	      <p>In the fast-paced world of finance, time is money.&nbsp; When Meteor Asset
	      Management approached me regarding their requirement for a full page advert,
	      we knew a fast turnaround would be crucial. I managed to complete the
	      project over the course of one day from initial brief to this initial
	      concept and eventual high resolution artwork for print. </p>

        <h2>La Plagne, Hoody</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/laplagne/idic-laplagne-hoody-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-laplagne" 
        title="La Plagne, Hoody"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-laplagne-hoody-thumb.jpg" alt="La Plagne Hoody" /></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/laplagne/idic-laplagne-hoody-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-laplagne" title="La Plagne, Hoody"></a>
      <p>This enjoyable personal project combined three of my passions: Design,
	        snowboarding and clothing. The challenge was to create an eye-catching
	        combination of typography and illustration to encapsulate a winter spent
	        in the snow for the seasonnaires of La Plagne, 2008. Bold lines were
	        used in the type to make the most of the single colour screen printing. </p>

        <h2>Jilly Vainer, Website</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/jvainer/idic-jvainer-website-01.jpg" rel="lightbox" 
        title="Jilly Vainer, Website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jillyvainer.co.uk&quot;target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;www.jillyvainer.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;">
      <img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-jvainer-website-thumb.jpg" alt="Jilly Vainer Website" /></a>
   	      <p>This freelance project had to be produced quickly and on a very
   	        low budget. The chosen concept made use of gentle tones and textures
   	        sympathetic to both the Yoga and sculpture aspects of Jilly's work.
   	        The layout from page to page varies to retain user interest whilst
   	        remaining true to an overall aesthetic. Significant work went in
   	        to adjusting the supplied digital snaps to allow the quality of Jilly's
   	        work to shine through. The HTML and CSS coding used throughout the
   	        site is designed to be extremely streamlined and highly visible to
   	        search engines.</p>

          <h2>Speednames, .me Banners</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/speednames/idic-speednames-banners-01.gif" rel="lightbox-speednames" 
        title="Speednames, .me Banners"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-speednames-banners-thumb.jpg" alt="Speednames Banners" /></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/speednames/idic-speednames-banners-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-speednames" title="Speednames, .me Banners"></a>
      <p>I produced this illustrative animated banner to stand out on the company’s
	        home page, attracting attention to the new .me domain names available.
	        It was important to achieve a certain amount of impact whilst remaining
	        sympathetic to Speednames’ brand guidelines. The final banner was developed,
	        produced and supplied within a few hours from the initial brief. </p>

        <h2>Marie Stopes International, GSAC Stand</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/msi-gsac/idic-msi-gsac-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-msi02" 
        title="Marie Stopes International, GSAC Stand"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-msi-gsac-thumb.jpg" alt="MSI GSAC" /></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/msi-gsac/idic-msi-gsac-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-msi02" title="Marie Stopes International, GSAC Stand"></a>
      <p>This stand for the Global Safe Abortion Conference was one of many
	        projects that I completed for the international healthcare organisation.
	        During the initial brief, we knew little more than how much floor space
	        we had. Eventually we settled on a welcoming horseshoe layout made up
	        of five pop-up stands that the not-for-profit organisation could reuse
	        for future events. I chose some bright colours from MSI’s corporate
	        palette and paid careful attention to how the panels would work together
	        or in isolation.</p>

        <h2>Print Management Systems, Brochure</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/pms/idic-pms-brochure-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-pms" 
        title="Print Management Systems, Brochure"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-pms-brochure-thumb.jpg" alt="PMS Brochure" /></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/pms/idic-pms-brochure-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-pms" title="Print Management Systems, Brochure"></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/pms/idic-pms-brochure-03.jpg" rel="lightbox-pms" title="Print Management Systems, Brochure"></a>
      <p>When the sister company of my former employer approached me to design
	        a promotional brochure it was clear that the solution should demonstrate
	        what can be achieved in print. The final design relied on sophisticated
	        print finishing and striking red on black adjusted imagery to create
	        a tactile and elegant end result.</p>

        <h2>Storetech, Identity and Folder</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/storetech/idic-storetech-identity-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-storetech" 
        title="Storetech, Identity and Folder"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-storetech-identity-thumb.jpg" alt="Storetech Identity" /></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/storetech/idic-storetech-identity-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-storetech" title="Storetech, Identity and Folder"></a>
      <p>When I first spoke to Storetech regarding their marketing material
	        it was clear that they were ready for a rebrand. The logo and corporate
	        suite that I produced made reference to their original brand but armed
	        the company with an entirely fresh image with which to drive sales. </p>
            
        <h2>Bedlam Bar, Flyer</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/bedlambar/idic-bedlambar-flyer-01.jpg" rel="lightbox" 
        title="Bedlam Bar, Flyer"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-bedlambar-flyer-thumb.jpg" alt="Bedlam Bar Flyer" /></a>
      <p>This A6 flyer was designed for high impact on a low budget to deliver
	        the cocktail bar a great result. The design was completed and produced
	        in a short amount of time using fluorescent inks in the straight jacket
	        illustration against a rich black background to seize the attention
	        of the Hampstead village nightlife. </p>

        <h2>Conjungo, Identity and History</h2>
        <a class="thumb" href="../rsrc/portfolio/conjungo/idic-conjungo-identity-01.jpg" rel="lightbox-conjungo" 
        title="Conjungo, Identity and History"><img src="../rsrc/thumbs/idic-conjungo-identity-thumb.jpg" alt="Conjungo Identity" /></a>
      <a href="../rsrc/portfolio/conjungo/idic-conjungo-identity-02.jpg" rel="lightbox-conjungo" title="Conjungo, Identity and History"></a>
      <p>Conjungo first approached me close to their inception and provided
	        a very open brief to create a new identity for the technology specific
	        search portal. After providing a wide and varied number of original
	        logo concepts, I developed the final logo and identity with their feedback
	        and have since completed a great number of projects to assist in the
	        development of their powerful website and marketing offering.</p>
